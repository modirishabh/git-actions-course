6. **Control Job Execution**
**Control Job Execution:** Learn how to control job execution by setting up dependencies, outputs, and job concurrency.

**Run Jobs in Container**s: Understand how to run jobs within containers.

**Matrix Strategies**: Explore matrix strategies to run a job multiple times with different configurations.

**6.1 Explore job concurrency, outputs, and dependencies**
**Job Dependencies**: Jobs can be configured to run sequentially using the needs keyword, ensuring one job completes before another starts.
**Job Outputs**: Outputs allow data sharing between jobs, but are not meant for artifacts like binaries or reports.
**Concurrency Groups**: Concurrency groups ensure only one job or workflow in the group runs at a time, preventing resource contention and improving performance

**6.3 Run jobs within containers**
Container Usage: Running jobs within containers allows you to start with the necessary environment and tools, making the process faster and more efficient.
Container Configuration: You can specify the container image within the container map, and pull images from different container registries, including Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry.
Additional Settings: You can configure settings like credentials for private registries, environment variables, ports, and mount volumes to enhance the container's functionality.
6.4 Container Usage: Running jobs within containers allows you to start with the necessary environment and tools, making the process faster and more efficient.
Container Configuration: You can specify the container image within the container map, and pull images from different container registries, including Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry.

6.4 Control job execution
Job Dependencies: Use the needs keyword to ensure that certain jobs run only after others have completed.
Job Outputs: Define and use output variables to share data between jobs.
Concurrency Groups: Manage job execution order within concurrency groups to prevent multiple jobs from running simultaneously when they share resources.

6.5 Explore matrix strategie
Matrix Strategies: Allows you to run a job with different variations such as environment, runtime, tools, and configurations, which is useful for testing and building on diverse platforms.
Configuration: Define a strategy map and within it, a matrix map with variables to create different job combinations. Use the include and exclude lists to manage these combinations.
Strategy Settings: Customize matrix job behavior with settings like fail-fast to cancel jobs on failure and max-parallel to define the number of jobs running simultaneously.

6.6 Implement matrix strategie
Creating a Repository: Set up a new repository with a README file and create a workflow file in the .github/workflows/ directory.
Defining Matrix Strategy: Configure the matrix strategy with different runners (e.g., ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest) and Python versions (e.g., 3.11, 3.12, 3.13).
Include and Exclude Configurations: Use include to add specific configurations and exclude to remove certain combinations from the matrix.
Job Execution: Define steps to run the job, specifying the runner and Python version from the matrix context, and execute the workflow to see the different job combinations.

**7 Integrate GitHub Actions, Create Custom Actions, Optimize Workflows**
Integrate GitHub Actions: Learn how to explore and integrate GitHub Actions into your workflows.
Create Custom Actions: Understand how to create custom actions, including composite, JavaScript, and Docker container actions.
Optimize Workflows: Learn about artifacts and cache to optimize your workflows, and practice sharing data between jobs using artifacts.

7.1 Understand actions in GitHub Actions

Types of Actions: GitHub Actions can be custom actions created by you or actions shared by the GitHub community. These include Composite, JavaScript, and Docker container actions.
Usage: Actions are used within workflows using the uses keyword, specifying the owner, repository, and version (tag, hash, or branch).
Parameters: Customize actions with parameters using the with keyword, and for Docker container actions, use the args keyword to pass arguments.

7.2 Discover and use actions in GitHub Actions
Creating a Repository: The video demonstrates how to create a new public repository, including adding a README file, a .gitignore file, and a license.
Setting Up a Workflow File: It explains how to create a workflow file in the .github/workflows directory, specifying the event trigger and job details.
Using Actions: The video shows how to add actions to your workflow from the GitHub Marketplace, including the checkout action, and how to configure its parameters.
